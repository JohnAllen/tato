720819	Why are there disappointments in human life?	720818	人生坎坷何為乎來哉？
720823	Usually they are all brought about by one’s own misdeeds and nothing more. For me, however, this is not the case; I am a man of great feeling, who values his word, and is straightforward and unrestrained, but these qualities have become the causes of problems for me.	720821	往往皆自作孽耳，余則非也，多情重諾，爽直 不羈，轉因之為累。
720825	How much more so for my father, the honourable Mr Jia, who is generous and chivalrous, anxious to help those in difficulty, deals with people’s problems, and helps people marry off their daughters and raise their sons; examples of these cannot be counted on one’s fingers. He spends money like dirt, much of it for other people.	720824	況吾父稼夫公慷慨豪俠，急人之難、成人之事、 嫁人之女、撫人之兒，指不勝屈，揮金如土，多為他人。
720827	When there were unexpected expenses in the household of me and my wife, we could not avoid pawning our belongings.	720826	余夫婦居家 ，偶有需用，不免典質。
720829	At first, we could make ends meet, but as it continued we became unable to cover our expenses.	720828	始則移東補西，繼則左支右絀。
720831	As the proverb goes, “To manage a household and maintain relationships, you cannot do without money.”	720830	諺云：「處家人情，非錢不行。」
720833	Initially this gave rise to gossip among petty people, and it gradually provoked criticism from members of our family.	720832	先起小人之議，漸招同室之譏。
720836	“A woman without talent – that’s virtue” - true words from the ancients of a thousand-years ago.	720834	「女子無才便是德」，真千古至言也！

722886	Truthful speech is not elegant, and elegant speech is not truthful. Good words are not persuasive, and persuasive words are not good. The knowledgeable are not many, and the many are not knowledgeable.	694271	信言不美，美言不信。善者不辯，辯者不善。知者不博，博者不知。
722887	The Way produces one, one produces two, two produces three, and three produces the myriad things.	694249	道生一，一生二，二生三，三生萬物。
738311	Although I was the eldest son in the family, I was the third child in the sequence, so everyone from superiors to inferiors called Yun “third lady.”	738310	余雖居長而行三，故上下呼芸為「三娘」。
738313	After a while, they suddenly started calling her “third wife”; at first it was a joke, but it went on to become a habit, to the extent that seniors and juniors, old and young all used “third wife” as her name. Was this the pivotal moment for disagreement in the family?	738312	後忽呼為「三太太」，始而戲呼，繼成習慣，甚至尊卑長幼，皆以「 三太太」呼之，此家庭之變機歟？
738317	In 1777, I followed my father to the government offices at Haining to work for him.	738314	乾隆乙巳，隨侍吾父於海寧官舍。
738320	Yun would enclose little notes in letters from home. My father said “Since your wife is capable with brush and ink, she can write your mother's letters from home for her.”	738318	芸於吾家書中附寄小函，吾父曰： 「媳婦既能筆墨，汝母家信付彼司之。」
738326	Later, it happened that there was some gossip at home, and my mother suspected that she had written something improper; after that she would not have her letters written for her.	738325	後家庭偶有閑言，吾母疑其述事不當，乃不令代筆。
738330	My father saw that the letters were not in Yun’s handwriting, and asked me “Is your wife ill?”	738327	吾父見信非芸手筆，詢余曰：「汝婦病耶？ 」
738334	I immediately wrote a letter to ask her, but she did not reply.	738332	余即作札問之，亦不答。
738337	After a while, my father got angry and said “It seems your wife will not stoop to being a substitute writer!”	738336	久之，吾父怒曰：「想汝婦不屑代筆耳！ 」
738341	It was not until I returned and sought it out that I knew the truth of the misunderstanding; I wanted to put things right appropriately, but Yun hurriedly stopped me, saying “I would rather suffer blame from your father than lose the fondness of your mother.”	738339	迨余歸，探知委曲，欲為婉剖，芸急止之曰：「寧受責於翁，勿失歡於姑也。」
738346	In the end, we did not confess.	738343	竟不自白。
738353	The ancient and the modern, the past and the future are all one.	737624	古今前後一也。

759897	At that time in the courts of the feudal lords there were many scholars who engaged in discrimination, such as the followers of Xun Kuang, who wrote books that were disseminated throughout the whole world.	759873	是時諸侯多辯士，如荀卿之徒，著書布天下。
