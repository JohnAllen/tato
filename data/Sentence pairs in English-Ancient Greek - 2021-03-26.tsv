1434	I love you.	2632788	Ἀγαπῶ σε.
1860	I don't want to go to school.	3633414	Οὐ βούλομαι φοιτᾶν εἰς τὸ διδασκαλεῖον.
1860	I don't want to go to school.	3633415	Οὐ βούλομαι πορεύεσθαι εἰς τὸ διδασκαλεῖον.
264823	Do good to those who hate you.	1824418	Καλῶς ποιεῖτε τοῖς μισοῦσιν ὑμᾶς.
281049	The sun is rising.	2735407	Ὁ ἥλιος ἀνατέλλει.
871789	I see the house.	2457968	Ὁρῶ τὴν οἰκίαν.
1215976	In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.	3286711	Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν.
1490740	Everything flows.	2980716	Πάντα ῥεῖ.
2365642	I love you!	2652886	Ἀγαπῶ σε!
2393705	I know that I know nothing.	2393710	Ἓν οἶδα ὅτι ουδὲν οἶδα.
2412739	I have two cats.	2927674	Δύο αἰλούρους ἔχω.
2619147	The ship is in Byzantium.	2458033	Τὸ πλοῖόν ἐστιν ἐν Βυζαντίῳ.
2393705	I know that I know nothing.	2652865	Ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα.
2657037	I live in Athens.	2657029	Ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις οἰκῶ.
2665425	Diceopolis is Athenian.	2458158	Ὁ Δικαιόπολιςς Ἀθηναῖός ἐστιν.
630767	Life is hard.	2458175	Χαλεπός ἐστιν ὁ βίος.
2739964	I have a friend.	2739961	Ἔχω φίλον.
433459	It's impossible.	2735409	Οὐ δυνατόν ἐστιν!
2896769	The man loves the house.	2657036	Ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὸν οἶκον φιλεῖ.
2896776	I have friends.	2739975	Ἔχω φίλους.
3100609	The soldiers follow the leader.	2724723	Οἱ στρατιῶται τῷ ἡγεμῶνι εἵποντο.
3100615	There weren't any other elephants nearby.	2951383	Oὔκ ὑπήρχον ἄλλοι ἐλέφαντες ἐγγύς
3100618	If you search well, you will find.	2730763	Ἐὰν ζητῆις χαλῶς, εὑρήσεις.
3100619	The animals run.	2730762	Tὰ ζῷα τρέχει.
3100620	Dicaeopolis slowly walks out of his house.	2732962	Ὁ Δικαιόπολις βραδέως ἐκβαίνει έκ τοῦ οἴκου.
3100621	Come here and help.	2732924	Ἐλθὲ δεῦρο καὶ συλλάμβανε.
3100622	But life is hard.	2657030	Χαλεπὸς δέ ἐστιν ὁ βίος.
3100623	I walk to the house.	2458182	Πρὸς τὸν οἶκον βαδίζω.
3100627	The friend educates the friend.	2739980	Ὁ φίλος τὸν φίλον παιδεύει.
3100632	I work for much time.	2657035	Πονῶ πολύν χρόνον.
3100641	I look over to Melissa.	2735403	Πρὸς τὸν Μέλιτταν βλέπω.
3100645	I work and always labor very much.	2732932	Ἐγώ πονῶ καὶ ἀεὶ μάλα κάμνω.
477063	Don't make noise.	2757779	Μὴ θορυβεῖτε.
3100660	The one thing I know is that I know nothing.	2652865	Ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα.
3100664	What do they have in mind?	2757749	Τί ἐν νῷ ἔχουσιν;
3100665	Dicaeopolis walks out of his house and calls his slave.	2732938	Ὁ Δικαιὀπολις ἐκβαίνει ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου καὶ καλεῖ τὸν δουλόν.
3100672	The elephant was alone and fainthearted.	2951410	Ὁ ἐλέφας ἦν μόνος καὶ ἄθυμος.
3100674	For the field is small, but the work is great.	2732935	Μικρὸς γάρ ἐστιν ὁ αγρός, μακρὸς δὲ ὁ πόνος.
3100677	Dicaeopolis is not present.	2735393	Ὁ Δικαιόπολις οὐ πάρεστιν.
3100681	I hear the noise.	2678277	Tὸν ψόφον ἀκούω.
3100708	I enjoy being honored by you.	2724060	Ἥδομαι ὑφ' ὑμῶν τιμώμενος.
3100712	I have never seen Socrates ever do wrong.	2724049	Oἶδα Σωκράτη οὐδεν πώποτε ἀδικήσαντα.
3100714	Oh Zeus, the farm does not provide much grain.	2657032	Ὤ Ζεῦ, ὁ κλῆρος οὐ πολὺν σῖτον παρέχει.
3100447	The man is strong.	2657033	Ἰσχυρός ἐστιν ὁ ἄνθρωπος.
3104207	Hasten slowly.	3103855	Σπεῦδε βραδέως.
3104208	War is the father of all.	3103854	πόλεμος πάντων μὲν πατήρ ἐστι.
3104209	My name is Nobody.	3103851	Οὖτις ἐμοί γ' ὄνομα.
3104210	Nothing in excess.	3103845	μηδὲν ἄγαν.
3104211	Cretans always lie.	3103839	Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται.
413600	Physician, heal thyself.	3103825	ἰατρέ, θεράπευσον σεαυτόν.
3104213	Either with it or on it.	3103820	ἢ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶς.
3104214	I have found it!	3103819	εὕρηκα!
280817	Know thyself.	3103812	γνῶθι σεαυτόν.
3104216	I grow old always learning many things.	3103811	γηράσκω δ' αἰεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενος.
3104217	Stand out of my sun.	3103808	ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡλίου μετάστηθι.
369696	The die is cast.	3103806	ἀνερρίφθω κύβος.
3104219	Ever to excel.	3103802	αἰὲν ἀριστεύειν.
3104220	There is learning in suffering.	3103750	πάθει μάθος.
3104222	Always seeking the truth.	3103751	πάντοτε ζητεῖν τὴν ἀλήθειαν.
3104224	Oh stranger, tell the Lacedaemonians that here we lie, obedient to their words.	3103743	Ὦ ξεῖν’, ἀγγέλλειν Λακεδαιμονίοις ὅτι τῇδε κείμεθα τοῖς κείνων ῥήμασι πειθόμενοι.
3169845	Master, remember the Athenians.	3103813	δέσποτα, μέμνεο τῶν Ἀθηναίων.
3169859	Doing wrong is worse than being wronged.	3103767	τὸ ἀδικεῖν τοῦ ἀδικεῖσθαι κάκιον.
3169885	What is it that having one voice becomes four-legged and two-legged and three-legged?	3103859	τί ἐστιν ὃ μίαν ἔχον φωνὴν τετράπουν καὶ δίπουν καὶ τρίπουν γίνεται;
3169890	Death in no way differs from life.	3103824	θάνατος οὐδὲν διαφέρει τοῦ ζῆν.
3169906	Bad friends bear bad fruit.	3103776	κακὸν φέρουσι καρπον οἱ κακοὶ φιλοι.
3169939	Give me somewhere to stand and I will move the earth.	3103815	δῶς μοι πᾶ στῶ καὶ τὰν γᾶν κινάσω.
3169945	It is not just to prefer strength to good wisdom.	3103784	οὐδὲ δίκαιον προκρίνειν ῥώμην τῆς ἀγαθῆς σοφίης.
3169952	Come and take it!	3103848	μολὼν λαβέ!
3227280	There was a village near the sea.	3227274	Ἦν μὲν οὖν τῆς θαλάττης πλησίον κώμη.
3549038	The sea is a road, because it leads to the islands.	3239756	Ὁδός ἐστιν ἡ θάλασσα, διότι εἰς τὰς νήσους ἄγει.
3621820	I think everybody should learn another language.	3623772	Πρέπει, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ, ἕνα ἕκαστον μανθάνειν ἄλλῃ τινὶ χρῆσθαι γλώσσῃ.
3717876	The beasts ran through the plain.	3239765	Τὰ θηρία ἔτρεχε διὰ τοῦ πεδίου.
4061960	First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.	4061956	Τίς εἶναι θέλεις, σαυτῷ πρῶτον εἰπέ: εἶθ' οὕτως ποίει ἃ ποιεῖς.
2203852	Tom teaches.	4089843	Ὁ Θωμᾶς παιδεύει.
1547675	Christ taught forgiveness.	4104393	Ὁ Χριστὸς τὴν συγγνώμην ἐπαίδευσεν.
2731791	It is not right to vex ourselves at things, for they care nought about it.	4107692	Τοῖς πράγμασιν γὰρ οὐχὶ θυμοῦσθαι χρεών˙ μέλει γὰρ αὐτοῖς οὐδέν.
2365642	I love you!	2632788	Ἀγαπῶ σε.
4640918	So you didn't see her yesterday by chance?	4239722	Ἆρα οὔκ εἶδες αὐτὴν κατὰ τύχην χθές;
4640931	Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.	3314475	Πάτερ ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς· ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου· ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου· γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου, ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον δὸς ἡμῖν σήμερον· καὶ ἄφες ἡμῖν τὰ ὀφειλήματα ἡμῶν, ὡς καὶ ἡμεῖς ἀφίεμεν τοῖς ὀφειλέταις ἡμῶν· καὶ μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν, ἀλλὰ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ.
4640935	You as well, child.	3218740	Καὶ σὺ τέκνον.
4640941	And I saw the new heaven and the new earth.	3195060	Καὶ εἶδον οὐρανὸν καινὸν καὶ γῆν καινήν.
4640945	Everything flows and nothing stays still.	3103858	τὰ πάντα ῥεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει.
4640978	Sea, fire, and woman, three disasters.	3103823	θάλασσα καὶ πῦρ καὶ γυνή, κακὰ τρία.
4640990	God always measures.	3103800	ἀεὶ ὁ θεὸς γεωμετρεῖ.
4641007	Money is for people the cause of many disasters.	3103761	πολλῶν τὰ χρήματ᾿ αἴτι᾿ ἀνθρώποις κακῶν.
545893	What are you?	2738504	Tί εἶ;
4680594	And they saw the new heaven and new earth.	3195060	Καὶ εἶδον οὐρανὸν καινὸν καὶ γῆν καινήν.
1434	I love you.	2652886	Ἀγαπῶ σε!
907672	Nothing endures but change.	5027416	πάντα ῥεῖ.
423252	One swallow does not make a spring.	5075132	μία χελιδὼν ἔαρ οὐ ποιεῖ.
5076041	Time is a god of the poor.	5076035	τοῖς πτωχοῖς ὁ χρόνος ἐστὶ θεός.
5094929	No one fights with us any longer.	5094928	Οὐδεὶς ἔτι ἡμῖν μάχεται.
5094931	Cyrus he sends for.	5094930	Κῦρον μεταπέμπεται.
5094933	Why are you driving us out?	5094932	Τί ἐξελαύνετε ἡμᾶς;
5094935	I have long been sorrowing lamenting for your woes.	5094934	Ἀλγῶ πάλαι δὴ τἀπὶ σοὶ στένων κακά.
5094937	They that have judgment everywhere prevail.	5094936	Οἱ φρονοῦντες εὖ κρατοῦσι πανταχοῦ.
5094940	Shall I report a truce or war?	5094938	Σπονδᾱ̀ς ἢ πόλεμον ἀπαγγελῶ;
5094942	He shall receive a talent as reward.	5094941	λήψεται μισθὸν τάλαντον.
5094944	With these we will fight.	5094943	σὺν τούτοις μαχούμεθα.
5094946	I shall not let him go at once.	5094945	οὐκ εὐθὺς ἀφήσω αὐτόν.
5094949	Won't you ever speak?	5094947	Οὔκουν ἐρεῖς ποτε;
5094951	They have left us.	5094950	Ἀπολελοίπᾱσιν ἡμᾶς.
5094953	You have heard, seen, suffered.	5094952	ἀκηκόατε, ἑωρᾱ́κατε, πεπόνθατε.
5094955	Thou hast sight and seest not.	5094954	Σὺ καὶ δέδορκας κοὐ βλέπεις.
5094957	Oinoë had been fortifed.	5094956	Oἰνόη ἐτετείχιστο.
5094959	But at that time they had revolted.	5094958	τότε δὲ ἀφειστήκεσαν.
5094961	He was in command of the mercenary force.	5094960	προειστήκει τοῦ ξενικοῦ.
5094964	Ariaios will at once withdraw, so that not a friend will be left us.	5094963	Εὐθὺς Ἀριαῖος ἀφεστήξει: ὥστε φίλος ἡμῖν οὐδεὶς λελείψεται.
5094966	I shall have received justice at your hands.	5094965	δίκαια πεπονθὼς ἐγὼ ἔσομαι ὑφʼ ῡ̔μῶν.
5094968	An army was being gathered.	5094967	Στράτευμα συνελέγετο.
5094970	He kept finding many pretexts.	5094969	πολλᾱ̀ς προφάσεις ηὕρισκεν.
5094972	These he used to distribute to his friends.	5094971	ταῦτα τοῖς φίλοις διεδίδου.
5094974	In doing that I was gaining nothing and was bringing myself into danger.	5094973	ταῦτα πρᾱ́ξᾱς ἐκέρδαινον μὲν οὐδὲν, ἐμαυτὸν δʼ εἰς κίνδῡνον καθῑ́στην.
5094976	Klearchos tried to force the soldiers to go; but they threw stones at him.	5094975	Κλέαρχος τοὺς στρατιώτᾱς ἐβιάζετο ἰέναι: οἱ δʼ αὐτὸν ἔβαλλον.
5094978	You don't come down to us in Piraeus at all often; yet you ought to.	5094977	Οὐδὲ θαμίζεις ἡμῖν καταβαίνων εἰς τὸν Πειραιᾶ· χρῆν μέντοι.
5094980	Why silent? Thou shouldst not be silent.	5094979	τί σῑγᾷς; οὐκ ἐχρῆν σῑγᾶν.
5094982	You ought to have done something.	5094981	ἀλλʼ ἐχρῆν τι δρᾶν.
5094984	Why, yes, we should have done this and this, and not have done that.	5094983	ἔδει γὰρ τὸ καὶ τὸ ποιῆσαι καὶ τὸ μὴ ποιῆσαι.
5094986	For these ought not to be alive.	5094985	τούσδε γὰρ μὴ ζῆν ἔδει.
5094988	The fitting thing was that you should foresee it.	5094987	εἰκὸς ἦν ῡ̔μᾶς προορᾶσθαι αὐτά.
5094990	For he might have stood his ground.	5094989	μένειν γὰρ ἐξῆν.
5094992	Taking up their poems, I would question them.	5094991	Ἀναλαμβάνων αὐτῶν τὰ ποιήματα διηρώτων ἂν αὐτούς.
5094996	I would be indignant (whenever people spoke hardly of me).	5094993	ἠγανάκτουν ἄν.
5095000	What treatment was I likely to get from you in case of detection?	5094998	Τί ἂν φανερὸς γενόμενος ὑφʼ ῡ̔μῶν ἔπασχον;
5095003	To what man was he probably sailing?	5095001	πρὸς ποῖον ἂν ἔπλει;
5095005	By that time it was late, and they would not be likely to see the hands.	5095004	τότε ὀψὲ ἦν καὶ τᾱ̀ς χεῖρας οὐκ ἂν καθεώρων.
5095007	But in that case the matter would have been decided by itself.	5095006	Τότε δʼ αὐτὸ τὸ πρᾶγμα ἂν ἐκρῑ́νετο ἐφʼ αὑτοῦ.
5095009	I should not wish to hear it even once.	5095008	κλύειν ἂν οὐδʼ ἅπαξ ἐβουλόμην.
5095012	I wish they were telling the truth; I too should have a share in that blessing.	5095010	Ἐβουλόμην ἂν αὐτοὺς ἀληθῆ λέγειν· μετῆν γὰρ ἂν καὶ ἐμοὶ τούτου τᾱ̓γαθοῦ μέρος.
5095016	There he remained.	5095014	Ἐνταῦθʼ ἔμεινεν.
5095019	He paid the army wages.	5095017	τῇ στρατιᾷ ἀπέδωκε μισθόν.
5095026	He (had) appointed him general also.	5095025	Καὶ στρατηγὸν δὲ αὐτὸν ἀπέδειξε.
5095029	I have often wondered.	5095028	πολλάκις ἐθαύμασα.
5095031	He did not adopt the view.	5095030	οὐκ ἔσχε τὴν γνώμην.
5095033	In that case (Athens) would have got the blame of betraying all.	5095032	τότε δὲ προδεδωκέναι πάντας ἂν ἔσχεν αἰτίᾱν.
5095035	Hippias received the rule.	5095034	Ἱππίᾱς ἔσχε τὴν ἀρχήν.
5095037	'Tis fortune gives success to art, not art to fortune.	5095036	Tύχη τέχνην ὤρθωσεν, οὐ τέχνη τύχην.
5095039	Picking out the right man, he would strike him.	5095038	Ἐκλεγόμενος τὸν ἐπιτήδειον ἔπαισεν ἄν.
5095041	Every man who saw it would get hot to be a warrior.	5095040	Ὁ θεᾱσάμενος πᾶς ἄν τις ἀνὴρ ἡράσθη δᾱ́ϊος εἶναι.
5095045	How was I, one who wasn't there, to do you any harm?	5095044	πῶς ἂν ὁ μὴ παρὼν ἐγώ τι σʼ ἡδίκησα;
5095047	Any one on seeing that would have been strengthened.	5095046	ἐπερρώσθη δʼ ἄν τις ἐκεῖνο ἰδών.
5095049	Who could have been found better in action than this man?	5095048	τούτου τίς ἄν σοι τᾱ̓νδρὸς δρᾶν ἀμείνων ηὑρέθη;
5095052	They would have done him no harm, but would perhaps have been on their guard against injury.	5095051	Ἐποίησαν μὲν οὐδὲν ἂν κακόν, μὴ παθεῖν δʼ ἐφυλάξαντʼ ἂν ἴσως.
5095056	Before it happened, any one hearing of it would have refused to believe it.	5095054	πρὶν γενέσθαι ἠπίστησεν ἄν τις ἀκούσᾱς.
5095063	In that way you would have revenged yourself on me.	5095061	Ἐν τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἦσθα ἄν με τετῑμωρούμενος.
5095068	O that I had so much power!	5095066	Εἰ γὰρ τοσαύτην δύναμιν εἶχον.
5095070	Would that Orestes were near.	5095069	εἴθʼ ἦν Ὀρέστης πλησίον.
5095072	Would that I had met you then.	5095071	εἴθε σοι τότε συνεγενόμην.
5095074	O that I had never seen thee.	5095073	εἴθε σε μήποτʼ εἰδόμᾱν.
5095076	Cyrus ought to be alive.	5095075	Ἀλλʼ ὤφελε Κῦρος ζῆν.
5095077	Ah! that Cyrus were living!	5095075	Ἀλλʼ ὤφελε Κῦρος ζῆν.
5095079	O that I had never left Skyros.	5095078	μήποτʼ ὤφελον λιπεῖν τὴν Σκῦρον.
5095082	What shall I experience?	5095080	Τί πάθω;
5095083	What will happen to me?	5095080	Τί πάθω;
5095085	Am I to fail of your fate?	5095084	ἀμπλάκω τοῦ σοῦ μόρου;
5095087	What shall we say to this? Anything else than to agree?	5095086	τί φῶμεν πρὸς ταῦτα; ἄλλο τι ἢ ὁμολογῶμεν;
5095089	What shall I do? Shall I be caught in wrong again?	5095088	τί δᾱ́ρσω; δεύτερον ληφθῶ κακός;
5095092	How can I desert the fleet?	5095091	πῶς λιπόναυς γένωμαι;
5095094	Shall I make no reply, but say something else?	5095093	μὴ ἀποκρῑ́νωμαι, ἀλλʼ ἕτερον εἴπω;
5095097	Shall I then propose the penalty of exile?	5095096	ἀλλὰ δὴ φυγῆς τῑμήσωμαι;
5095100	Whither shall one flee? Where shall I go and abide?	5095098	Ποῖ τις οὖν φύγῃ; ποῖ μολὼν μενῶ;
5095103	Are, then, these people to believe you are doing this for them?	5095101	εἶτα ταῦτʼ οὗτοι πεισθῶσιν ὑπὲρ αὑτῶν σε ποιεῖν;
5095105	My children, let us rise.	5095104	Ὦ παῖδες, ἱστώμεσθα.
5095107	Let us rise, go out here into the court, and pass the time walking about there; then let us go.	5095106	δεῦρο ἐξαναστῶμεν εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν καὶ περιιόντες αὐτοῦ διατρῑ́ψωμεν, εἶτα ἴωμεν.
5095109	Let me go to her!	5095108	φέρʼ ἐπʼ αὐτὴν ἴω.
5095111	Come, now, let me also read the testimony.	5095110	φέρε δὴ καὶ τᾱ̀ς μαρτυρίᾱς ἀναγνῶ.
5095113	Let us not wait for οthers.	5095112	Μή ἀναμένωμεν ἄλλους.
5095115	Let me not be wronged.	5095114	μὴ δῆτʼ ἀδικηθῶ.
5095117	Leave me not thus alone.	5095116	Μή λίπῃς μʼ οὕτως μόνον.
5095121	Let no one speak.	5095119	Μηδεὶς εἴπῃ.
5095123	Let this occur to no one.	5095122	μηδενὶ τοῦτο παραστῇ.
5095125	May she not spoil thy marrriage.	5095124	Μὴ σοὺς διαφθείρῃ γάμους.
5095127	You will not convince the wise (I fear).	5095126	μὴ οὐ πείσῃs σοφούς.
5095130	(I fear) it's rather rude to speak the truth.	5095129	Μὴ ἀγροικότερον ᾖ τὸ ἀληθὲς εἰπεῖν.
5095133	But (I suspect) that is not difficult.	5095131	ἀλλὰ μὴ οὐ τοῦτʼ ᾖ χαλεπόν.
5095137	The gods forever graciously abide with you!	5095135	Εὖ ξυνεῖεν εἰσαεὶ θεοί.
5095139	So may I win the victory and be deemed wise.	5095138	οὕτω νικήσαιμί τʼ ἐγὼ καὶ νομιζοίμην σοφός.
5095141	May you die!	5095140	ὅλοιο.
5095143	May none of you consent to this.	5095142	μηδεὶς ταῦτʼ ῡ̔μῶν ἐπινεύσειεν.
5095146	Mayst thou never learn who thou art.	5095145	Εἴθε μήποτε γνοίης ὅς εἶ.
5095149	May it only depend on that!	5095148	εἰ γὰρ ἐν τούτῳ εἴη.
5095154	I should hesitate myself to go aboard the boats.	5095151	Ἐγὼ ὀκνοίην ἄν εἰς τὰ πλοῖα ἐμβαίνειν.
5095157	There one would learn much self-control.	5095155	ἔνθα πολλὴν σωφροσύνην καταμάθοι ἄν τις.
5095160	And by force you would never take him.	5095159	πρὸς βίᾱν δʼ οὐκ ἂν λάβοις.
5095164	For he would not injure me at all; for he would not even be able to.	5095162	ἐμὲ μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲν ἂν βλάψειεν· οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν δύναιτο.
5095211	I would not yield the chair.	5095210	Οὐκ ἂν μεθείμην τοῦ θρόνου.
5095213	How should I find death?	5095212	Πῶς ἂν ὀλοίμᾱν;
5095215	Where might the strangers be?	5095214	Ποῦ δῆτʼ ἂν εἶεν οἱ ξένοι;
5095217	But these men might be wise in some greater wisdom.	5095216	Οὗτοι δὲ τάχʼ ἂν μείζω τινὰ σοφίᾱν σοφοὶ εἶεν.
5095219	What human trespass would constrain thy power, O Zeus?	5095218	Τεᾱ́ν, Zεῦ, δύνασιν τίς ἀνδρῶν ὑπερβασίᾱ κατάσχοι;
5095221	But take her within, slaves.	5095220	Ἀλλά νιν κομίζετʼ εἴσω, δμῶες.
5095223	Let them go.	5095222	ἰόντων.
5095225	Let no one of you speak.	5095224	μηδεὶς ῡ̔μῶν λεγέτω.
5095227	Neither be afraid nor let fly an evil word.	5095226	Μἠτʼ ὀκνεῖτε μήτʼ ἀφῆτʼ ἔπος κακόν.
5095229	Do that for me, my son, delay no more, nor mention Troy again.	5095228	ταῦτά μοι πρᾶξον, τέκνον, καὶ μὴ βράδῡνε μηδʼ ἐπιμνησθῇς ἔτι Tροίᾱς.
5095231	Stop, speak no farther!	5095230	παῦε, μὴ λέξῃς πέρᾱ.
5095233	Let it be otherwise.	5095232	ἄλλως ἐχέτω.
5095235	No one shall ever say.	5095234	Οὔποτε ἐρεῖ οὐδείς.
5095238	Do not in any case flee.	5095237	μὴ φύγητε μηδαμῇ.
5095240	And he does not merely write this and then not carry it out in deeds.	5095239	Καὶ οὐ γράφει μὲν ταῦτα τοῖς δʼ ἔργοις οὐ ποιεῖ.
5095242	No serious news, I hope?	5095241	Μή τι νεώτερον ἀγγέλλεις;
5095244	You don't suppose he was anxious about death, do you?	5095243	μὴ αὐτὸν οἴει φροντίσαι θανάτου;
5095246	He hasn't injured you, has he?	5095245	μῶν τί σε ἀδικεῖ;
5095248	But perhaps you mean that your learning will be not like that.	5095247	Ἀλλʼ ἄρα μὴ οὐ τοιαύτην ὑπολαμβάνεις σου τὴν μάθησιν ἔσεσθαι.
5095250	I shall not be caught by a trick.	5095249	Οὔ τι μὴ ληφθῶ δόλῳ.
5095253	He will never yield.	5095251	οὐ μὴ πίθηται.
5095255	Not one of the enemy will stay any longer.	5095254	οὐδεὶς μηκέτι μείνῃ τῶν πολεμίων.
5095257	The king will no longer be able to catch us.	5095256	οὐκέτι μὴ δύνηται βασιλεὺς ἡμᾶς καταλαβεῖν.
5095259	I will never follow thee.	5095258	Οὔ σοι μὴ μεθέψομαί ποτε.
5095261	Don't keep chattering.	5095260	οὐ μὴ λαλήσεις.
5095266	There's need of a fight.	5095265	μάχης δεῖ.
5095268	A truce if we stay; if we leave or advance, war.	5095267	Σπονδαὶ μὲν μένουσιν, ἀπιοῦσι δὲ ἢ προϊοῦσι πόλεμος.
5095270	Our two brothers wrought their common death.	5095269	Ἀδελφὼ δύο μόρον κοινὸν κατειργάσαντο.
5095272	It seemed to me best to try to attain safety in this way.	5095271	ἐδόκει μοι ταύτῃ πειρᾶσθαι σωθῆναι.
5095274	I am called the son of Achilles, Neoptolemos.	5095273	Αὐδῶμαι δὲ παῖς Ἀχιλλέως, Nεοπτόλεμος.
5095276	Thus pitilessly am I chastised, a sight of evil fame for Zeus.	5095275	Nηλεῶς ὧδʼ ἐρρύθμισμαι, Ζηνὶ δυσκλεὴς θέᾱ.
5095278	Giving up their arms is not the victorsʼ part.	5095277	οὐ τῶν νῑκώντων ἐστὶ τὰ ὅπλα παραδιδόναι.
5095280	One would justly put it down to our neglect.	5095279	τῆς ἡμετέρᾱς ἀμελείᾱς ἄν τις θείη δικαίως.
5095282	Pray, of what land or lineage should I rightly call you?	5095281	ποίᾱς πάτρᾱς ἂν ἢ γένους ῡ̔μᾶς ποτε τύχοιμʼ ἂν εἰπών;
5095287	He took part in no good thing, but in many of another sort.	5095286	Ἀγαθοῦ μὲν οὐδενὸς μετέσχεν ἄλλων δὲ πολλῶν.
5095293	Aiming at great souls, you would not miss.	5095292	Mεγάλων ψῡχῶν ῑ̔εὶς οὐκ ἂν ἁμάρτοις.
5095295	Why, what other good of learning should I enjoy?	5095294	τί γὰρ ἄλλʼ ἂν ἀπολαύσαιμι τοῦ μαθήματος;
5095297	Thou remindest me of sorrows.	5095296	Μιμνήσκεις κακῶν.
5095299	For intelligence and truth and the soul you take no care or thought.	5095298	Φρονήσεως καὶ ἀληθείᾱς καὶ τῆς ψῡχῆς οὐκ ἐπιμελεῖ οὐδὲ φροντίζεις.
5095301	But I care less than naught for Zeus.	5095300	ἐμοὶ δʼ ἔλασσον Zηνὸς ἢ μηδὲν μέλει.
5095304	For toil alone the gods sell all good things.	5095303	τῶν πόνων πωλοῦσιν ἡμῖν πάντα τᾱ̓γάθʼ οἱ θεοί.
5095308	I shall obey the god rather than you.	5095306	πείσομαι μᾶλλον τῷ θεῷ ἤ ῡ̔μῖν.
5095310	Toil to toil brings toil.	5095309	πόνος πόνῳ πόνον φέρει.
5095315	Death is common to all and inevitable for man.	5095313	θάνατον πᾶσι κοινὸν [ἐστὶ] καὶ ἀναγκαῖον ἀνθρώποις
5095317	Thοu seest the giver of fire to mortals.	5095316	πυρὸς βροτοῖς δοτῆρʼ ὁρᾷς.
5095320	Are not you the cause of this for me?	5095318	οὐ σύ μοι τῶνδʼ αἰτίᾱ;
5095323	For you the command of Zeus hath consummation.	5095322	σφῷν μὲν ἐντολὴ Διὸς ἔχει τέλος.
5095326	So lightly dο the multitude take the search for truth.	5095325	οὕτως ἀταλαίπωρος τοῖς πολλοῖς ἡ ζήτησις τῆς ἀληθείᾱς.
5095329	By being with wise men you will yourself become wise.	5095328	σοφοῖς ὁμῑλῶν καὺτὸς ἐκβήσῃ σοφός.
5095332	They gained superior strength both by access of wealth and by rule over others.	5095331	ἰσχὺν περιεποιήσαντο χρημάτων τε προσόδῳ καὶ ἄλλων ἀρχῇ.
5095335	He never had men who followed him by reason of affection and gοod-will.	5095334	φιλίᾱͅ μὲν καὶ εὐνοίᾱͅ ἑπομένους οὐδέποτε εἶχεν.
5095338	All with one impulse worshiped the god.	5095337	πάντες μιᾷ ὁρμῃ προσεκύνησαν τὸν θεόν.
5095341	Most wretchedly by far do I go down.	5095340	κάκιστα δὴ μακρῷ κάτειμι.
5095343	Art is far weaker than necessity.	5095342	τέχνη δʼ ἀνάγκης ἀσθενεστέρᾱ μακρῷ.
5095345	They die of fear of such expeditions.	5095344	Tεθνᾶσι τῷ δέει τοὺς τοιούτους ἀποστόλους.
5095349	Thou wilt come to the brawling stream, not falsely named.	5095347	Ἥξεις Ὑβριστὴν ποταμὸν οὐ ψευδώνυμον.
5095351	To thee all this power has come.	5095350	σὲ τόδʼ ἐλήλυθε πᾶν κράτος.
5095353	What art thou that hast come to glorious Thebes?	5095352	τίς ποτε ἀγλαᾱ̀ς ἔβᾱς Θήβᾱς;
5095356	The Syrians regarded the fishes as gods.	5095355	τοὺς ἰχθῦς οἱ Σύροι θεοὺς ἐνόμιζον.
5095359	I will also remind you of the dangers of your forefathers.	5095358	ἀναμνήσω ῡ̔μᾶς καὶ τοὺς τῶν προγόνων κινδῡ́νους.
5095361	What wrong did you receive from me, that you are now scheming against me?	5095360	Tί ἀδικηθεὶς ὑπʼ ἐμοῦ νῦν ἐπιβουλεύεις μοι;
5095363	'Tis better to be ill in body than in soul.	5095362	βέλτῑόν ἐστι σῶμά γʼ ἢ ψῡχὴν νοσεῖν.
5095366	He endured to sacrifice his daughter, as an aid to war.	5095365	Ἔτλη θυτὴρ γενέσθαι θυγατρός, πολέμων ἀρωγᾱ́ν.
5095368	As a test of this, first go to Pytho and inquire about the response.	5095367	τῶνδʼ ἔλεγχον τοῦτο μὲν Πῡθώδʼ ἰών πεύθου τὰ χρησθέντα.
5095371	It is like a criminal to die by sentence of court, but like a general to die fighting with the enemy.	5095370	Κακούργου ἐστὶ κριθέντʼ ἀποθανεῖν, στρατηγοῦ δὲ μαχόμενον τοῖς πολεμίοις.
5095373	Virtue is a thing that may be taught.	5095372	Διδακτόν ἐστιν ἡ ἀρετή.
5095376	Truly my mother bore me as one of evil fate.	5095375	ἦ βαρυδαίμονα μήτηρ μʼ ἔτεκεν.
5095381	Does he say it of his own knowledge?	5095380	Αὐτὸς ξυνειδώς φησιν;
5095383	Things will come of themselves.	5095382	ἥξει γὰρ αὐτά.
5095385	You there, what are you doing?	5095384	Oὗτος, τί ποιεῖς;
5095388	Here come the boys.	5095387	οἵδε παῖδες στείχουσι.
5095391	It is no time for sleeping or for being careless of ourselves.	5095390	οὐχ ὥρᾱ καθεύδειν οὐδʼ ἀμελεῖν ἡμῶν αὐτῶν.
5095393	I am not one (was not born) to join in hatred, but in love.	5095392	οὔτοι συνέχθειν ἀλλὰ συμφιλεῖν ἐφῦν.
5095395	He had nothing to tell.	5095394	Oὐδὲν εἶχε φράσαι.
5095398	At length they have wrought it out so as to pay the penalty.	5095397	χρόνῳ ποτʼ ἐξέπρᾱξαν ὡς δοῦναι δίκην.
5095400	Many devices there are for escaping death.	5095399	Μηχαναὶ πολλαί εἰσιν ὥστε διαφεύγειν θάνατον.
5095402	He made dreadful threats, so that neither by night nor day did sleep cover me.	5095401	δείνʼ ἐπηπείλει, ὥστʼ οὔτε νυκτὸς ὕπνον οὔτʼ ἐξ ἡμέρᾱς ἐμὲ στεγάζειν.
5095407	We let you off, on this condition however, that you no longer seek wisdom.	5095405	ἀφῑ́εμέν σε, ἐπὶ τούτῳ μέντοι, ἐφʼ ᾧτε μηκέτι φιλοσοφεῖν.
5095409	I go down before my allotted term of life is over.	5095408	κάτειμι πρίν μοι μοῖραν ἐξήκειν βίου.
5095412	I could not persuade the Titans.	5095411	Πιθεῖν Τιτᾶνας οὐκ ἠδυνήθην.
5095414	I am about to suffer.	5095413	μέλλω παθεῖν.
5095418	It is just to remember god when one is prospering.	5095416	Δίκαιον εὖ πρᾱ́ττοντα μεμνῆσθαι θεοῦ.
5095420	This man I forbid any one to receive or address.	5095419	τὸν ἄνδρʼ ἀπαυδῶ μήτʼ ἐνδἐχεσθαι μήτε προσφωνεῖν τινα.
5095422	Do you deny that you have done this?	5095421	καταρνεῖ μή δεδρᾱκέναι τάδε;
5095424	Why then do you delay to tell the whole?	5095423	τί δῆτα μέλλεις μὴ οὐ γεγωνίσκειν τὸ πᾶν;
5095426	Fear instead of sleep stands near, that I close not my eyes.	5095425	φόβος ἀνθʼ ὕπνου παραστατεῖ, τὸ μὴ βλέφαρα συμβαλεῖν.
5095428	One must learn letters, and learning them have sense.	5095427	Γράμματα μαθεῖν δεῖ καὶ μαθόντα νοῦν ἔχειν.
5095430	For young people silence is better than talking.	5095429	Nέοις τὸ σῑγᾶν κρεῖττόν ἐστι τοῦ λαλεῖν.
5095432	Minos put down piracy, that his revenues might come to him better.	5095431	Μίνως τὸ λῃστικὸν καθῇρει τοῦ τᾱ̀ς προσόδους μᾶλλον ἰέναι αὐτῷ.
5095434	You say you spoke against those who wished to destroy us.	5095433	ἀντιλέγειν φῇς τοῖς βουλομένοις ἡμᾶς ἀπολέσαι.
5095436	Do you suppose they expected to be suffering like this?	5095435	ἆρα προσδοκᾶν αὐτοὺς τοιαῦτα πείθεσθαι οἴεσθε;
5095439	It is folly to think the state we live in is so great that we shall suffer nothing serious.	5095437	Mωρίᾱ τηλικαύτην ἡγεῖσθαι πόλιν οἰκεῖν τὸ μέγεθος ὥστε μὴ δεινὸν πείσεσθαι.
5096190	This, though I knew it well, I had let slip.	5096189	ταῦτα γὰρ καλῶς ἐγὼ εἰδὼς διώλεσα.
5096193	Not without sorrow shalt thou twice speak words so dire.	5096192	οὔ τι χαίρων δίς γε πημονᾱ̀ς ἐρεῖς.
5096195	I should like to get away without his knowing it.	5096194	βουλοίμην ἂν λαθεῖν αὐτὸν ἀπελθών.
5096197	They kept using the enemiesʼ arrows.	5096196	διετέλουν χρώμενοι τοῖς τῶν πολεμίων τοξεύμασι.
5096199	He was plainly not envious of the openly wealthy.	5096198	οὐ φθονῶν τοῖς φανερῶς πλουτοῦσιν ἐφαίνετο.
5096201	I never ceased pitying ourselves.	5096200	Oὔποτε ἐπαυόμην ἡμᾶς οἰκτῑ́ρων.
5096203	They have gone forward in pursuit.	5096202	Εἰς τὸ πρόσθεν οἱχονται διώκοντες.
5096205	He is guilty of corrupting the young.	5096204	ἀδικεῖ τοὺς νέους διαφθείρων.
5096207	And now I have observed that some felt upleasantly toward me for this reason too.	5096206	ἤδη δέ τινων ᾐσθόμην καὶ διὰ ταῦτα ἀχθομένων μοι.
5096209	They delight in the examination of those who think they are wise but are not.	5096208	χαίρουσιν ἐξεταζομένοις τοῖς οἰομένοις μὲν εἶναι σοφοῖς οὖσι δʼ οὔ.
5096211	We see that we are unable to get the upper hand.	5096210	ἡμεῖς ἀδύνατοι ὁρῶμεν ὄντες περιγενέσθαι.
5096213	She perceived that she had been wronged.	5096212	ᾔσθετʼ ἠδικημένη.
5096220	Affairs are in a bad way with you doing nothing of what you should.	5096219	οὐδὲν τῶν δεόντων ποιούντων ῡ̔μῶν κακῶς τὰ πρᾱ́γματα ἔχει.
5096222	When it is possible to have peace, he chooses war.	5096221	Ἐξόν εἰρήνην ἔχειν αἱρεῖται πολεμεῖν.
5096257	Socrates used to pray to the gods simply to give what was good, feeling that the gods knew best.	5096223	Σωκράτης ηὔχετο πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ἁπλῶς τᾱ̓γαθὰ διδόναι, ὡς τοὺς θεοὺς κάλλιστα εἰδότας.
5096261	The baggage animals extended a long away, because the road they were following was narrow.	5096260	Ἐπὶ πολὺ ἦν τὰ ὑποζύγια, ἅτε διὰ στενῆς τῆς ὁδοῦ πορευόμενα.
5096265	I went to one of the men who seemed to be wise, thinking that there I should test the oracle.	5096264	ἦλθον ἐπί τινα τῶν δοκούντων σοφῶν εἶναι, ὡς ἐνταῦθα ἐλέγξων τὸ μαντεῖον.
5096267	Another arose, pointing out the simplicity of the man who suggested asking for boats, just as if Cyrus were making the expedition back again.	5096266	Ἄλλος ἀνέστη ἐπιδεικνῡ̀ς τὴν εὐήθειαν τοῦ τὰ πλοῖα αἰτεῖν κελεύοντος, ὥσπερ πάλιν τὸν στόλον Κῡ́ρου ποιουμένου.
5096269	You show that you have something new to reveal.	5096268	δηλοῖς δʼ ὥς τι σημανῶν νέον.
5096270	You seem as one about to reveal something new.	5096268	δηλοῖς δʼ ὥς τι σημανῶν νέον.
5096273	Socrates, who would easily have been acquitted by the judges, chose to die.	5096271	Σωκράτης ῥᾱͅδίως ἂν ἀφεθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν δικαστῶν προείλετο ἀποθανεῖν.
5096275	We at least must make a struggle for freedom.	5096274	Ἡμῖν γʼ ὑπὲρ τῆς ἐλευθερίᾱς ἀγωνιστέον.
5096277	I had to go therefore to all those who appeared to have some knowledge.	5096276	ἰτέον οὖν ἐπὶ ἅπαντας τούς τι δοκοῦντας εἰδέναι.
5096280	You have heard, seen, suffered, you have him; give judgment.	5096279	ἀκηκόατε, ἑωρκατε, πεπόνθατε, ἔχετε· δικάζετε.
5096282	What, then, is this? Distrust. Guard this, cling to this.	5096281	Tί οὖν ἐστι τοῦτο; ἀπιστίᾱ. ταύτην φυλάττετε, ταύτης ἀντέχεσθε.
5096284	For right worthily hath Phoibos, and worthily hast thou, bestowed this care for him that is dead.	5096283	ἐπαξίως γὰρ Φοῖβος, ἀξίως δὲ σὺ πρὸ τοῦ θανόντος τήνδʼ ἔθεσθʼ ἐπιστροφήν.
5096286	Be assured, however, I shall tell you the whole truth.	5096285	εὖ μέντοι ἴστε, πᾶσαν ῡ̔μῖν τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἐρῶ.
5096288	Do not abandon us, I entreat.	5096287	ἱκνοῦμαι μὴ προδοὺς ἡμᾶς γένῃ.
5096290	I should like very much to hear the name, who is so skilled in talking?	5096289	ἥδιστʼ ἂν ἀκούσαιμι τὸ ὄνομα, τίς οὕτως ἐστὶ δεινὸς λέγειν;
5096292	I'm afraid yοu need a whipping.	5096291	Δέδοικα μὴ πληγῶν δἐει.
5096295	Beware lest it be shameful too as well as evil.	5096294	ὅρᾱ μὴ ἅμα τῷ κακῷ καὶ αἰσχρὰ ᾖ.
5096297	Stop, that you be not found foolish.	5096296	παῦσαι, μὴ ἐφευρεθῇς ἄνους.
5096299	Let one undo my shoes, lest from afar an envious look should smite me.	5096298	ὑπαί τις ἀρβύλᾱς λῡ́οι, μή τις πρόσωθεν ὄμματος βάλοι φθόνος.
5096302	What I do not know, I also do not think I know.	5096301	ἅ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.
5096305	Now I praise you for what you both say and do.	5096304	Nῦν ἐπαινῶ σε ἐφʼ οἷς λέγεις τε καὶ πρᾱ́ττεις.
5096307	He broke down every one.	5096306	Oὐδἐνα ὅντινʼ οὐ κατέκλασε.
5096309	They send against me such people, whom you would not justly believe.	5096308	Tοιούτους ἐπιπέμπουσί μοι, οἷς ῡ̔μεῖς οὐκ ἂν δικαίως πιστεύοιτε.
5096311	I will tell thy wandering, which do thou write in the tablets of thy memory.	5096310	πλάνην φράσω, ἥν ἐγγράφου σὺ μνήμοσιν δέλτοις φρενῶν.
5096313	Those griefs give most pain that are seen to be self-chosen.	5096312	Tῶν πημονῶν μάλιστα λῡποῦσʼ αἵ φανῶσʼ αὐθαίρετοι.
5096315	Whereas before I had no pretext on which to give an account of my life, now I have got one.	5096314	πρότερον οὐκ ἔχων πρόφασιν ἐφʼ ἧς τοῦ βίου λόγον δοίην, νῡν εἴληφα.
5096318	But whomsoever the state appoints, him we should obey.	5096317	ἀλλʼ ὅν πόλις στήσειε, τοῦδε χρὴ κλύειν.
5096320	Nor is there any weapon of thought wherewith to defend.	5096319	Oὐδʼ ἔνι φροντίδος ἔγχος ᾧ τις ἀλέξεται.
5096322	Though it was in my power not to die for you, but to get as husband whom I would of the Thessalians.	5096321	Παρόν μοι μὴ θανεῖν ὑπὲρ σέθεν, ἀλλʼ ἄνδρα σχεῖν Θεσσάλων ὃν ἤθελον
5096324	And every one is harsh that's new in power.	5096323	ἅπᾱς δὲ τρᾱχὺς ὅστις ἂν νέον κρατῇ
5096326	With you I will suffer whatever we must.	5096325	σὺν ῡ̔μῖν ὅ τι ἂν δεῄ πείσομαι.
5096329	It is a fine thing, whoever has a trusty tongue.	5096327	καλόν τοι γλῶσσʼ ὅτῳ πιστὴ παρῇ.
5096332	It is shameful for you that any (penalty) whatever should be lacking which any one might wish to exact from these men.	5096331	αἰσχρὸν ῡ̔μῖν καὶ ἡντινοῦν δίκην ἀπολιπεῖν ἥντινά τις βούλοιτο παρὰ τούτων λαμβάνειν.
1490740	Everything flows.	5027416	πάντα ῥεῖ.
5096555	Everything flows and nothing remains.	4909640	Πάντα ῥεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει.
5109394	And among them rose the hero son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, lamenting: his blackened heart brimming over with rage, and his eyes like blazing fires.	5108730	τοῖσι δ᾽ ἀνέστη ἥρως Ἀτρεΐδης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων ἀχνύμενος: μένεος δὲ μέγα φρένες ἀμφιμέλαιναι πίμπλαντ᾽, ὄσσε δέ οἱ πυρὶ λαμπετόωντι ἐΐκτην.
1635231	Hi, friend!	2679162	Χαῖρε, ὦ φίλε!
413731	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.	5285785	Εἴς, δύο, τρεῖς, τέσσαρες, πέντε, ἕξ, ἑπτά, ὀκτώ, ἐννέα, δέκα.
3104214	I have found it!	4726353	εὕρηκα
5290763	My sword is my life.	5304407	Τὸ ἐμοῦ ξίφος είναι τὸ ζωή μου.
5353138	Be so kind, then, as to give me this gift.	5095168	Οὐκοῦν πόροις ἂν τήνδε δωρεᾱ̀ν ἐμοί;
6042772	Life is short, and Art long; the crisis fleeting; experience perilous, and decision difficult.	6042768	Ὁ βίος βραχύς, ἡ δὲ τέχνη μακρή, ὁ δὲ καιρὸς ὀξύς, ἡ δὲ πεῖρα σφαλερή, ἡ δὲ κρίσις χαλεπή.
6046875	How old is this book?	6048227	πηλίκη ἐστιν ἡ βίβλος.
6077272	The soldier kicked Layla awake.	6078347	ὁ στρατιώτης τύπῳ ἐγήγερκε τὴν Λαῖλαν.
6077620	This ship is sinking.	6078324	ἥδε ναῦς δύεται.
6078232	I'll show you the photo now.	6078376	φανῶ σοι νῦν τὸ εἰκόνιον.
6196197	You write well.	6207664	Καλῶς γράφεις.
2506500	He writes badly.	6207674	Κακῶς γράφει.
5758017	Tom writes badly.	6207677	Ὁ Θωμᾶς κακῶς γράφει.
2270527	Don't run away.	6207678	Μὴ φεῦγε.
2270527	Don't run away.	6207679	Μὴ φεύγετε.
2693510	Tom writes well.	6207681	Ὁ Θωμᾶς καλῶς γράφει.
2272803	Tom is a friend.	6210690	Ὁ Θωμᾶς φίλος ἐστίν.
302443	He is a friendly person.	6210691	Φίλος ἐστίν.
2236851	Tom is simple.	6210699	Ὁ Θωμᾶς ἁπλοῦς ἐστιν.
410244	She is beautiful.	6210702	Καλή ἐστιν.
6600424	Each person judges well the things he knows.	6600413	ἕκαστος δὲ κρίνει καλῶς ἃ γιγνώσκει.
6600425	He is a good judge of the things that he knows.	6600414	ἀγαθὸς κριτής ἐστι τούτων, ἃ γιγνώσκει.
6600427	Therefore, a young person is not an appropriate student of politics.	6600416	διὸ τῆς πολιτικῆς οὐκ ἔστιν οἰκεῖος ἀκροατὴς ὁ νέος.
6600428	A young person is unexperienced in the affairs of life.	6600417	ἄπειρος ὁ νεὸς τῶν κατὰ τὸν βίον πράξεων.
6600430	The accounts are from and about those things.	6600419	οἱ λόγοι δ'εἰσίν ἐκ τούτων καὶ περὶ τούτων.
6600432	Every art and every inquiry seem to aim at some good.	6600420	πᾶσα τέχνη καὶ πᾶσα μέθοδος ἀγαθοὺ τινὸς ἐφίεσθαι δοκεῖ.
6600435	Every action and every undertaking seem to aim at some good.	6600421	πᾶσα πρᾶξίς τε καὶ προαίρεσις ἀγαθοὺ τινὸς ἐφίεσθαι δοκεῖ.
6600539	There appears to be a difference of customs.	6600529	διαφορὰ δὲ τις φαίνεται τῶν νόμων.
6600540	There appear to be different customs.	6600529	διαφορὰ δὲ τις φαίνεται τῶν νόμων.
6600541	Custom is the ruler of all.	6600530	νόμος πάντων βασιλεύς.
6600542	Law is the king of all.	6600530	νόμος πάντων βασιλεύς.
6600543	Custom is the king of all.	6600530	νόμος πάντων βασιλεύς.
6600544	The goal of medicine is health.	6600531	τὸ τῆς ἰατρικῆς τέλος ὑγίειά ἐστιν.
6600546	The goal of the practice of medicine is health.	6600531	τὸ τῆς ἰατρικῆς τέλος ὑγίειά ἐστιν.
6600547	Victory is the goal of strategy.	6600532	ἡ νίκη τῆς στρατηγικῆς τέλος.
6600548	Victory is the end of strategy.	6600532	ἡ νίκη τῆς στρατηγικῆς τέλος.
6600551	Wealth is the goal of managing one's affairs.	6600533	πλοῦτος τὸ τῆς οἰκονομικῆς τέλος ἐστίν.
6600560	And if there is some goal of actions that we desire for itself, it is clear that that will be the Good and the best.	6600534	εἰ δή τι τέλος ἐστὶ τῶν πρακτῶν ὃ δι' αὑτὸ βουλόμεθα, δῆλον ὡς τοῦτ' ἄν εἴη τἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ ἄριστον.
6600563	If that is so, we have to try to comprehend what it is.	6600535	εἰ δ' οὕτω πειρατέον περιλαβεῖν αὐτὸ τί ποτ' ἐστι.
6600619	We are each one, but together we are two.	6600618	ἓν ἑκάτερον, ἀμφότερα δὲ δύο.
6600620	Each is one, but together two.	6600618	ἓν ἑκάτερον, ἀμφότερα δὲ δύο.
6632775	But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.	6632772	αἰτείτω δὲ ἐν πίστει, μηδὲν διακρινόμενος, ὁ γὰρ διακρινόμενος ἔοικεν κλύδωνι θαλάσσης ἀνεμιζομένῳ καὶ ῥιπιζομένῳ·
6632780	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.	6632769	αἱ δὲ φρόνιμοι ἔλαβον ἔλαιον ἐν τοῖς ἀγγείοις μετὰ τῶν λαμπάδων ἑαυτῶν.
6632789	My brothers, do not be children in mind: in evil be as little children, but in mind be of full growth.	6632768	Ἀδελφοί, μὴ παιδία γίνεσθε ταῖς φρεσίν, ἀλλὰ τῇ κακίᾳ νηπιάζετε, ταῖς δὲ φρεσὶν τέλειοι γίνεσθε.
6632815	Brothers, let me put this in human terms. Even a human covenant, once it is ratified, cannot be canceled or amended.	6632761	Ἀδελφοί, κατὰ ἄνθρωπον λέγω· ὅμως ἀνθρώπου κεκυρωμένην διαθήκην οὐδεὶς ἀθετεῖ ἢ ἐπιδιατάσσεται.
6632891	Dear friends, although I was making every effort to write to you concerning our common salvation, I considered it a necessity to write to you to encourage you to contend for the faith delivered once and for all to the saints.	6632888	Ἀγαπητοί, πᾶσαν σπουδὴν ποιούμενος γράφειν ὑμῖν περὶ τῆς κοινῆς ἡμῶν σωτηρίας ἀνάγκην ἔσχον γράψαι ὑμῖν παρακαλῶν ἐπαγωνίζεσθαι τῇ ἅπαξ παραδοθείσῃ τοῖς ἁγίοις πίστει.
6632900	For we hear that some among you are living irresponsibly, working at nothing, but being busybodies.	6632899	ἀκούομεν γάρ τινας περιπατοῦντας ἐν ὑμῖν ἀτάκτως, μηδὲν ἐργαζομένους ἀλλὰ περιεργαζομένους·
6674881	One may be satisfied that there are no senses apart from the five from the following arguments.	6674880	Ὅτι δ᾿ οὐκ ἔστιν αἴσθησις ἑτέρα παρὰ τὰς πέντε ἐκ τῶνδε πιστεύσειεν ἄν τις.
6674899	For all those things which are qualities of the tangible object, qua tangible, we perceive by touch.	6674886	πάντα γὰρ τὰ τοῦ ἁπτοῦ ᾗ ἁπτὸν πάθη τῇ ἁφῇ ἡμῖν αἰσθητά ἐστιν.
6674924	If we currently have perception of everything for which the sense is touch it is also necessary that, lacking some sense, we will also lack some sense organ.	6674905	εἰ γὰρ παντὸς οὗ ἐστὶν αἴσθησις ἁφή, καὶ νῦν αἴσθησιν ἔχομεν, ἀνάγκη τ᾿, εἴπερ ἐκλείπει τις αἴσθησις, καὶ αἰσθητήριόν τι ἡμῖν ἐκλείπειν.
6675563	Then, upon seeing her beauty, I began debating with myself.	3220591	Ταύτης οὖν ἰδὼν τὸ κάλλος διελογιζόμην ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου.
6677360	If the master is not present, the slave does not work.	3220497	Εἰ μὴ πάρεστιν ὁ δεσπότης, ὁ δοῦλος οὐ πονεῖ.
6677582	When the ship sails, the captain looks toward the land.	2458111	Τὸ μὲν οὖν πλοῖον πλεῖ, ὁ δὲ κυβερνήτης πρὸς τὴν γῆν βλέπει.
6686121	I was born to join in love, not in hate.	5095392	οὔτοι συνέχθειν ἀλλὰ συμφιλεῖν ἐφῦν.
292029	Where was he going?	6686566	Ποῖ ᾔει;
6694615	You will arrive at the accurately named Violent River.	5095347	Ἥξεις Ὑβριστὴν ποταμὸν οὐ ψευδώνυμον.
6704716	That's how you would have avenged me.	5095061	Ἐν τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ ἦσθα ἄν με τετῑμωρούμενος.
1868134	Tom is working.	6777916	Ὁ Θωμᾶς πονεῖ.
2244645	Is Tom working?	6777920	Ἆρα ὁ Θωμᾶς πονεῖ;
2272935	Tom is always working.	6777922	Ἀεὶ πονεῖ ὁ Θωμᾶς.
2912788	The woman is working.	6777925	Ἡ γυνὴ πονεῖ.
6919721	But Love wanted to make a match of his own devising.	6919714	ὁ δὲ Ἔρως ζεῦγος ἴδιον ἠθέλησε συμπλέξαι
6919724	There was a public feast of Aphrodite.	6919723	Ἀφροδίτης ἑορτὴ δημοτελὴς ἦν.
6919727	Almost every woman had gone to the temple.	6919726	πᾶσαι σχεδὸν αἱ γυναῖκες ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὸν νεών.
6919729	So smitten, Chaereas could barely make his way home.	6919728	Ὁ μὲν οὖν Χαιρέας οἴκαδε μετὰ τοῦ τραύματος μόλις ἀπῄει.
6919732	Τhe night came terribly upon them both.	6919731	Νὺξ ἐπῆλθεν ἀμφοτέροις δεινή.
2745283	I'm looking for my cat.	7004724	Τὸν αἴλουρόν μου ζητῶ.
